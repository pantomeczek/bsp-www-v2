<div class="mt-4 p-0 muted-text">

  <p>This chart presents an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin's Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator, a crucial metric for understanding market sentiment and investor behavior within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The SOPR indicator calculates the profit ratio of spent outputs by dividing the selling price by the paid price of Bitcoin transactions. This analysis helps identify potential trend reversals and investor sentiment shifts by observing whether values are above or below the baseline of 1, indicating profit or loss, respectively.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Above 1:</strong> When the SOPR value is above 1, it indicates that investors are selling Bitcoin at a profit. This condition often correlates with bullish market sentiment, where holders are confident enough to realize gains.</li>
    <li><strong>Below 1:</strong> Conversely, a SOPR value below 1 suggests that investors are selling Bitcoin at a loss. This scenario is typically associated with bearish market conditions, indicating panic sells or forced liquidations.</li>
    <li><strong>At 1:</strong> A SOPR value at exactly 1 implies that the overall market is breaking even. This can be a critical inflection point, signaling either a potential market stabilization or indecision among investors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The chart's analysis of Bitcoin's SOPR over time provides investors and analysts with a visual tool to gauge the overall profit and loss realization in the market, offering insights into market cycles and potential turning points.</p>
