        This chart provides an insightful look into the current state of Bitcoin holders by comparing the percentage of addresses that are in profit versus those that are in loss. It offers a visual representation of the distribution between Bitcoin addresses that are holding their assets at a value higher than the price they initially paid (in profit) and those that are holding assets below their acquisition cost (in loss). </br>
        The 'in profit' category signifies the portion of Bitcoin addresses where the current market price of Bitcoin exceeds the acquisition price, indicating that these holders would make a gain if they sold their Bitcoin now. This reflects the successful accumulation of value over time, as well as the resilience of Bitcoin as an asset during bullish periods.</br>

        Conversely, the 'in loss' category includes addresses where the current Bitcoin price is lower than the price at which the holders initially purchased their coins, meaning that selling at the present moment would result in a financial loss. This section can serve as a useful indicator of market stress, especially during bearish trends or times of heightened volatility.</br>
        By analyzing this distribution, investors and market analysts can gauge the overall sentiment of Bitcoin holders. A higher percentage of addresses in profit might signal positive market conditions and long-term holder confidence, while a greater percentage of addresses in loss may reflect bearish sentiment or recent price drops.</br>

        This data can be crucial for understanding broader market trends, identifying potential reversal points, and making informed investment decisions based on the financial positions of existing Bitcoin holders.</br>
