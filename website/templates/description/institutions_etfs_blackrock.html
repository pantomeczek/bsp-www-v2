<div class="mt-4 p-0 muted-text">

    <p>BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), provides investors the opportunity to track the price movements of bitcoin without directly holding the digital currency. This spot bitcoin ETF is distinct from futures-based ETFs, which are based on bitcoin futures contracts, in that it directly holds bitcoin as its primary asset.</p>

    <p>The application for the iShares Bitcoin Trust by BlackRock was submitted to the SEC on June 15, 2023, and achieved approval in just seven months. On January 11, 2024, the SEC green-lit IBIT along with 10 other spot bitcoin ETFs for operation.</p>

    <p>Investors can purchase shares of IBIT through their existing brokerage accounts, trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange.</p>

    <h4>What constitutes a spot bitcoin ETF?</h4>
    <p>A spot bitcoin ETF is a form of investment fund available on stock exchanges, similar to traditional ETFs that might hold stocks, commodities, or bonds. These funds are designed to mirror the net asset value (NAV) of the assets they hold, allowing for trading throughout the day. Spot bitcoin ETFs specifically hold bitcoin, offering investors a route to engage with the price fluctuations of bitcoin without the complexities and security concerns of buying and storing the digital asset themselves.</p>

    <p>Trading on established stock exchanges, ETFs generally provide greater liquidity compared to cryptocurrency exchanges. This liquidity facilitates easier buying and selling of ETF shares at market prices, without exerting a significant influence on the market itself.</p>

    <p>Moreover, spot bitcoin ETFs come under the purview of regulatory bodies, offering a layer of security and reassurance absent in the realm of unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges. This regulatory framework aims to reduce risks associated with fraud, market manipulation, and operational failings, enhancing investor protection.</p>
